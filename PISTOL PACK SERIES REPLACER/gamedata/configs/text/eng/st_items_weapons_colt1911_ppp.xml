		<text>The Coonan .357 Magnum is a peculiar semi-auto gun that uses .357 Magnum done through the chassis of a Colt 1911. This is done by changing the barrel, slide, handle and magazine to accommodate the caliber change. By the looks of it, this came through the Zone thanks to...Some sinister group, how they have acquired it is a mystery, but by the looks of how unkempt, contrasted and slightly broken the gun looks, it could even be an illegal clone of the original Coonan. Sadly, the weapon isn't exactly the best when it comes to accuracy, but the recoil is tolerable (as long as you don't rapid-fire) and the handling is great, one main benefit of using this instead of some other .357 pistols like the Desert Eagle is the conceal carry, weight and better Close Quarters Combat.</text>

		<text>Strayer-Voigt Inc. is a manufacturer of M1911-styled modular pistols, this especially includes the Strayer-Voigt Infinity itself, SVI for short. It is a pistol marketed for competition, so it is rather expensive and rare as it's not available for any army or average arms-bearing citizen. How did this even get in The Zone? No doubt from those flamboyant American mercenaries. The pistol itself has the massive benefit of having its own trademark Strayer-Voigt magazine, which holds 15 rounds. It has also been modified in-house to shoot in 3-burst at a fast rate. Oh and, if none of that makes you happy, the tritium optic fiber will, since it's blue. However, don't expect the same good ol' reliability as the classic 1911. \n \n
